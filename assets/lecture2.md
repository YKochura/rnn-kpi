class: middle

**Computer vision** is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do. [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision)]

Computer Vision іs used in image understanding, search, apps, mapping, medicine, drones, and self-driving cars.  Core visual recognition tasks to many of these applications are image classification, localization and object detection. Recent success of neural networks (aka “deep learning”) have greatly advanced the performance of these state-of-the-art visual recognition systems.
